                SilentBridge is currently in its early conceptual phase. This vision 
                represents our aspirational roadmap for developing AI-assisted communication tools. 
                We&aposre openly sharing these ideas to gather feedback, build a community of 
                like-minded individuals, and work together towards making this vision a reality.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4">
                While we&aposre still in the learning and planning stages, we believe in 
                the potential of combining AI with AAC systems to create more intuitive 
                and personalized communication tools. We invite researchers, developers, 
                and AAC experts to join us in exploring these possibilities.
