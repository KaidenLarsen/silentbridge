# SilentBridge 

SilentBridge is an open-source AI-powered augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) platform designed to empower non-verbal autistic individuals with more natural and effective communication tools.

## Vision

Our goal is to transform AAC technology by leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence to create a more adaptive, context-aware, and personalized communication experience. SilentBridge aims to bridge the gap between traditional AAC tools and the dynamic needs of non-verbal individuals.

## Features

- üß† **AI-Powered Personalization**
  - Adapts to individual communication styles and preferences
  - Learns from user interactions to improve over time
  - Supports diverse input methods including gestures, eye gaze, and touch

- üåç **Context Awareness**
  - Real-time analysis of environmental factors
  - Situation-appropriate vocabulary suggestions
  - Dynamic symbol grid reorganization based on context

- ‚ö° **Predictive Capabilities**
  - Advanced word and phrase prediction
  - Reduces cognitive load during communication
  - Improves communication speed and efficiency

## Current Status

SilentBridge is currently in the research and development phase. We are:

- üìö Studying machine learning fundamentals and multimodal transformer architectures
- üîç Researching AAC system requirements and constraints
- ü§ù Exploring ethical considerations in AI-assisted communication
- üõ†Ô∏è Building our initial development infrastructure

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Machine Learning**: Transformers architecture (in development)
- **Deployment**: [TBD]
